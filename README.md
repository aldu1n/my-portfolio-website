# My Portfolio Website

## Description

I made this portfolio of my work to showcase my skills and knowledge to potential employers looking for web developers. The statics shows that web developers who have portfolios with deployed web applications are typically very successful in their career search.

With these points in mind, I made this website using the skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 
The sites features my previous work , as well as placeholders for adding my future work. It uses basic principles of responsive desing to make webpage more responsive and user-friendly on any most device sizes.
